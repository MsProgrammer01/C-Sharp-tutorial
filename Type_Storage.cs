                  in the bigning of learn C# , you need to Know about type and 
                  learning C# consists of learning how to create and use types
                  some of the type is a simple type like (int , long, shurt...) can store only a single data item. 
                  other type is can store multiply item like (Array)

                   Data type 
                   We have three part of the Data type
                 
                 1- Reference Data Types : require two segments (part) of memory .
                   The first contains the actual data and is always located in the heap.
                   The second is a reference that points to where the data is stored in the heap.
                   (For reference types, the actual data is stored in the heap, and the reference is stored on the stack)

                 2- Value Data type : require only a single segment (part) of memory, which stores the actual data.
                    (for value type Data is stored on the stack )

                 3- Pointer Data Type: that points to an address of a value,
                    We can say that the symbols used are Pointer Data Type such as & and *
                    



                   Stack and Heap 
                   when an program is running, its data must be stored in memory ,where and how it’s stored?
                   A running program uses two part of memory to store data: the stack and the heap.

                   
                   stack 
                   Stack is a special type of collection that stores elements in LIFO (Last In First Out) 
                   LIFO means The last item added can be removed first.
                   And addition items is called push and deviation items is called pop.


                   Heap 
                   It is an area of memory allocated to store certain kinds of data objects.
                   In it data can be stored and removed in any order.
                   here Garbage Collection removes all items that do nothing or have no origin.

                   Predefined Data Types and Users defined Data Types
